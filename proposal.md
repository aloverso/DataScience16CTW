#Change the World Proposal

Anne LoVerso and Zhecan Wang(James)

##Main idea and why

Our topic for the project is about abortion rights for women.  Many people aren’t aware that even in states that have legal abortion clinics, there are a large number of laws in place that make it hard for clinics to stay open and hard for women to get abortions.  We’d like to look at this data and construct a visualization that will raise awareness about the arbitrary restrictions lawmakers have placed on women’s rights and hopefully encourage people to take action or vote to prevent laws.  Viewing our visualization will try to convince people that women who want abortions are often unable to get them, and that we as a society should be doing something about this.  We care about changing this because abortion is a women’s rights issue of bodily autonomy, and women should have access to this care.  

##MVP and Stretch Goals

Our MVP will be a representative data visualization for people who don’t have previously comprehensive knowledge of American abortion situation can quickly understand the current overall situation and status. The MVP will include multiple graphs and probably a geographical map which indicates the abortion status across the country.

After creating a representative data visualization model, our stretch goal may be to learn to use Javascript D3 tools to convert the graph into more fancy web representations.

##Data sources

We’re looking into different data sources we can use for this project.  It will likely require the use of a combination of sources.  So far we’ve found a comprehensive list of the location (address) of all US abortion clinics, and a database of records of all abortion-clinic related crimes in the US since the 90s.  These data sources will allow us to show some visualizations about how women may or may not have access to a nearby clinic and their safety.  Next, we’ll need to find data about laws on a state-by-state basis.

##Workflow and Schedule

Our schedule plan is that we’ll spend the first week getting our data and making sure it is in a usable format.  We’ll use seaborn to analyze and create preliminary visualizations of the data, since this is a tool we’re familiar with.  The second week, we plan to expand and try to learn d3 so that we could use this tool to create a web-based interactive visualization. 

The general workflow will be that we will split the work based on the schedule so that we both can conveniently work individually and research about the project. Then we will meet frequently in a weekly basis to share insights, pair program and discuss about strategies. 

Our assessment plan for the final deliverable is to display that we have both created a compelling visualization and that we have expanded our knowledge in the data visualization space.  We both have learning data visualization tools and practices as part of our learning goals for this project, so we hope to try to learn D3.  However, since we’re both approaching it without having used it before, we want to create something that proves we’ve learned something first and foremost without holding ourselves to unrealistic expectations for picking it up.  We’d like to be assessed on how much we learned, how we were able to create a good visualization, and whether our project shows a compelling story about our topic.
